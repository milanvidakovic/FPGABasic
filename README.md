# FPGABasic
TinyBasic port to my FPGA computer

if you managed to change moxiebox-gcc to produce assembly code for my FPGA platform, then you just need to install Java and then you can type:
make

That would build the basic executable as basic.bin file. Load that file into the emulator and you will see my incredible BASIC port :)
